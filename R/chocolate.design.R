#' Choice Model Design For a Study of Chocolate Bar Preferences
#'
#' A discrete choice experimental design generated
#' using \code{\link{ChoiceModelDesign}} examining preferences for
#' chocolate bars. 403 respondents were each asked six choice questions
#' involving choosing between four alternatives of chocolate bars. The
#' question asked each respondent for the choice questions was
#' "Which of these 2 ounce chocolate bars would you choose to buy?".
#' The responses are available in \code{\link{chocolate}}. The first
#' 150 versions of the design were generated using a random design and
#' the second 150 versions were generated using the efficient algorithm
#' in \code{\link{ChoiceModelDesign}}.
#'
#' An object of class \code{c("list", "ChoiceModelDesign")}. See
#' \code{\link{ChoiceModelDesign}} for a description of the
#' components.
