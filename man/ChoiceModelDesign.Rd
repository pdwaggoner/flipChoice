        indicating the average frequency balance of the versions,

\details{
If \code{prior} is supplied and \code{design.algorithm ==
    "Efficient"}, the number of coefficients must correspond
    to the number of attributes/attribute levels specified in
    \code{attribute.levels}.  If \code{prior} is \code{NULL}, the prior for the
    coefficients is assumed to be identically zero.  If the supplied matrix
    contains two columns, the first column is taken as the prior
    mean for the coefficients and the second is taken to be the
    prior variances.  If only one column is present, the prior for
    the coefficients is assumed to be centered at those values.

 Details for the possible choices for \code{design.algorithm} are as follows.
\itemize{
\item \code{Random} - Randomly chooses levels, only ensuring alternatives
are not identical within a question.
\item \code{Shortcut} -  The design is built with each alternative consisting
of the least frequently used Level for each attribute. If levels are equally frequent,
the least used level within the question is selected, or else a random choice is made.
\item \code{Complete enumeration} -  For each alternative, every possible alternative
is evaluated and the one with the lowest cost selected. The cost of an alternative
depends on its incremental impact upon the design in terms of a combination of
single level balance, pairwise level balance and level overlap within questions.
\item \code{Balanced overlap} -  As per \code{"Complete enumeration"} except level
overlaps are less strongly penalized.
\item \code{Partial profiles} -  The design is chosen using a recent algorithm for partial
profiles.  See the references.
\item \code{Efficient} - Equivalent to \code{"Partial profiles"} with
\code{n.constant.attributes = 0}.
\item \code{Modfed} The design is chosen using a modified Federov algorithm to
optimize the D-error, so that the variance of the model parameter estimates
is minimized. Uses \code{\link[idefix]{Modfed}}.
\item \code{Alternative specific - Random} Creates a design with attributes that
are specific to each alternative. Random levels are chosen for each attribute.
\item \code{Alternative specific - Federov} Creates a design with attributes
that are specific to each alternative. The design is optimized to maximize the
information about the model parameters, given the responses.
