\title{Compute the D-error of an unlabeled design (according to Huber and Zwerina
1996)}
\usage{
DError(design.matrix, attribute.levels, effects = TRUE, prior = NULL,
  n.rotations = 10, seed = 123, has.question.and.task = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design.matrix}{is a matrix for an unlabeled choice design in the long
format, meaning that each row describes one of the alternatives in one
of the choice tasks. Complete data for each task is spread across
several rows. The columns are:
- Column 1 indicates the version number for each profile
- Column 2 indicates the question number for each profile
- Column 3 indicates the task number for each profile
- Column 4 indicates the alternative number
- Columns 5 and up each correspond to an attribute, with the entries in
  the columns indicating the level of the attribute (beginning at level
  1).
Either column 2 or 3 can be omitted if the parameter
has.question.and.task is set to FALSE.}

\item{attribute.levels}{is a vector of numbers indicating how many levels
are in each attribute. The order should correspond to the order of
columns in the design.}

\item{effects}{is a boolean parameter indicating whether or not the error
should be computed based on effects coding (TRUE) or dummy coding
(FALSE).}

\item{prior}{is a vector of prior parameters for the attribute levels.
Keeping prior = NULL uses a flat prior.}

\item{n.rotations}{The number of random rotations performed when computing
the Bayesian criterion/error when the prior mean and variance are
supplied for partial profiles.}

\item{seed}{Integer; random seed to be used by the algorithms.}

\item{has.question.and.task}{Whether both the question and task columns are
supplied in the design. If FALSE, only either the question or task
should be present.}
