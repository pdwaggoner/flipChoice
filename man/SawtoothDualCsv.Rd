\arguments{
\item{design}{A choice model design object.}

as a "none" option.}

\item{design.file}{Name of the design csv file to export.}

\item{design.out.file}{Name of the out-of-sample design csv file to
export. This is to be used as an input into SawtoothAccuracy.}

\description{
Creates the design and response .csv files to be used as input
    to Sawtooth CBC HB (dual csv format). Also outputs a covariates .csv
    file if covariates are supplied. Remember to select "Code variables
    using dummy coding" in the Sawtooth settings.
